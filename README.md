## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Its me Ajish Suresh Kumar 
Master student in Electrical & Electronics Engineering focuses on Embeded sytems, PCB Desigining and IoT.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on optimizing energy-efficient scheduling for IoT edge devices (ESP32/FreeRTOS) and gesture-controlled automation projects.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced RTOS frameworks,Optimization of Single-Multi-Distributed core of Microcontroller(ESP32).
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Open-source hardware projects, PCB design optimization, or embedded and IoT applications systems.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Low-power wireless protocols (e.g., LoRaWAN) and distributed core microcontroller architectures.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about PCB design (Altium), hardware-software co-design, or sensor integration for IoT!
